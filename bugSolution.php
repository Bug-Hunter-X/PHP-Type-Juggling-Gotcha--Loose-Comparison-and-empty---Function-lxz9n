The solution lies in using strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks both the value and the data type of the variables.  Here's the corrected code:

```php
$value = "10";

if ($value === 10) {
  echo "Values are equal";
} else {
  echo "Values are not equal";
}
```

This will now correctly output "Values are not equal" because the data types differ.  To address the issue with the `empty()` function, more explicit checks should be used:

```php
$variable = 0;
if ($variable === 0 || $variable === "0") {
  echo "Variable is considered empty in a loose sense";
}
if ($variable === NULL || $variable === FALSE) {
    echo "Variable is strictly NULL or FALSE";
}
if ($variable === 0 ) {
    echo "Variable is numerically zero";
}
else {
    echo "Variable is not empty";
}
```

This approach offers more precise control and avoids unintended consequences stemming from type juggling.  Always prefer strict comparisons (`===`) unless you specifically need loose comparisons for a particular reason. Remember to thoroughly test your code to ensure it functions as expected under various conditions.
