In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with type juggling and comparisons.  Consider this code snippet:

```php
$value = "10";

if ($value == 10) {
  echo "Values are equal";
} else {
  echo "Values are not equal";
}
```

This will output "Values are equal", even though `$value` is a string and `10` is an integer. PHP's loose comparison (`==`) performs type juggling, converting the string "10" to an integer 10 before comparison.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in conditional logic.

Another example involves using the `empty()` function:

```php
$variable = 0;
if (empty($variable)) {
    echo "Variable is empty";
} else {
    echo "Variable is not empty";
}
```

This will print "Variable is empty" even though `$variable` holds a numeric value. `empty()` considers `0`, `0.0`, `"0"`, `NULL`, `false`, and empty arrays as empty, making it prone to misinterpretation if not carefully handled.
